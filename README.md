## Overview

The Logistic Regression Project aims to build a predictive model for breast cancer classification using logistic regression. This project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `BreastCancer.csv`, which contains features extracted from breast cancer tumors. The target variable indicates whether the tumor is benign or malignant.

# Installation

To set up and run the project, you need to have Python installed along with the necessary libraries. You can use `pip` or `conda` to install the required libraries.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Using `pip`

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/logistic_regression_project.git
   cd logistic_regression_project

## Results

The logistic regression model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook includes visualizations to help understand the performance of the model.
